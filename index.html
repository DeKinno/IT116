        When Spider-Man first appeared in the early 1960s, 
        teenagers in superhero comic books were usually relegated 
        to the role of sidekick to the protagonist. The Spider-Man
         series broke ground by featuring Peter Parker, a high school
          student from Queens, New York, as Spider-Man's secret 
          identity, whose "self-obsessions with rejection, inadequacy
          , and loneliness" were issues to which young readers could relate.
